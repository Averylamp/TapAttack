This repository contains the app Tap Attack!.  It is currently unfinished and features a player tapping circular icons that appear on the screen.  The icons increase with speed and they may be red icons.  The objective of the game is to gain as many points as possible, tapping the graphical, green, or golden icons, while avoiding all red icons.  I have not decided whether I will be using graphical icons in the final version.  Currently implemented is an option that allows the user to take a picture and use it as a graphical option.
